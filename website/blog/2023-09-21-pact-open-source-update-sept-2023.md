### Pactober Builders

During Pactober, we'd love to invite you to help build something on our roadmap, take part in a Bug-Bash or in our Doc-Drive.
 
_Need some inspiration?_

We've got plenty of requests on our [Canny roadmap](https://pact.canny.io/feature-requests), and although many are not planned, you can see from the votes, as to how well received it may be from the community. 
 
Alternatively, we can look at outstanding issues and PR's as they can often serve as a good source of inspiration, or things that can easily be sewn up.
 
Finally, don't forget to check out more ways you can help, https://docs.pact.io/contributing  if any of these take your fancy?|

You can find your fellow builders over in the #pactober-builders channel in Slack.
 

### Pactober Workshops

We akready a few Pact HTTP based workshops, in a few languages, listed [here](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/workshops#pact-workshops---from-0-to-pact-in-2-hours)

I'll be hosting four sessions throughout Pactober, walking users through the existing workshop, and running some all new ones in the process.

- [Pactober Workshop 1 - CI/CD workshop (HTTP Pact)](https://github.com/pact-foundation/devrel/issues/21)
- [Pactober Workshop 2 - CI/CD workshop (Message Pact)](https://github.com/pact-foundation/devrel/issues/22)
- [Pactober Workshop 3 - CI/CD workshop (Plugin Pact)](https://github.com/pact-foundation/devrel/issues/23)
- [Pactober Workshop 4 - Maintainer/contributor workshop How Pact is built](https://github.com/pact-foundation/devrel/issues/24)

We will need to build out workshops for Message & Plugin Pact, and also our various existing workshops, could do with some love, to utilse the latest features and versions of 
not only Pact but to reflect the newer styles of creating API's in each respective language.

We would love any support in helping work on these, but if not, and you just fancy participating along with others during the workshops, then feel free to join me!


## OSS Updates

It has been another busy month in the world of Pact, I've pulled out some changes from the changes from community to showcase in our latest round of Open Source updates.

## Thats a wrap

That’s it for this month. Stay safe and carry on coding!
