## Pact Almanac 2024

Grab your hoverboard, and get prepared for another trip back to the future, with our round up of this years Pactivities in our seasonal Pact Almanac.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19932401/207968429-dad9294a-2221-41cb-b387-6acd7c0bba4f.png)

We had a raft of code features, patches, fixes and new projects added to the Pact-Foundation over the year. If you haven't read our monthly blog posts, you can read a round-up of the most significant changes from each month in there. Check out the side-bar to the left to view the older posts.

I've mainly focused on video content this time round, where you can find multiple advocates of Pact, spreading the word of not just how to do contract testing, but the why. I hope you'll enjoy them, be sure to like and comment on the videos, whether it's to show your appreciation or you just fancy a debate.

Oh, and if you are the debating type, why not join us in a fireside chat next year?

Anyhow, let see what each month has in store for us.

### January

üßë‚Äçüíª Tien Vo started by year by continuing and productionising the migration of Pact-PHP over to the Rust core. We saw the first community created [pact_compatibility_suite examples](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2024/02/19/pact-open-source-update-feb-2024#php) land this month, and Tien has worked diligently all year, in implementing not only new features to Pact-PHP, but contributions to the Pact ecosystem as a whole, from an [RFC](https://github.com/pact-foundation/roadmap/pull/99) for `form-urlencoded` matching ability, to several changes in the Pact-Rust core and Pact-Plugin ecosystem. It has seen great feedback from users, including Steve Taylor.

> Not an issue as such, just want to say I love it. (I'm using 10-alpha3)
> 
> It's so much faster and simpler, and I'm looking forward to using some of the newer Pact specification features.
> 
> My API tests came across easily without much fuss.

Pact-PHP v10, was made generally available in September, in this [release](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-php/releases/tag/10.0.0).

Well done Tien! Your hard work has paid off and is very much appreciated by the community.

We've often wondered when a book dedicated to contract testing would appear on the scene. We even had this statement on the books section of our site

> We're not aware of any books currently dedicated to contract testing, but here are some that talk about Pact and contract testing as part of a broader microservices development and testing strategy

However good news everybody üé∫ the first one was launched back in April.
