## ⏳ And just like that, 2023 draws near

We at the Pact team love nothing more than making microservices testing easier, our community and churning out the code. This year has been no exception. As many of you have wrapped up for your christmas break, we thought we would take some time to reflect on the year and the communities achievements.

## Pact Open Source Community Survey

Our new survey is now open! The purpose of this survey is a pulse check on the community. In order to serve you in the best possible way, we'd love to understand how you use Pact and engage in our ecosystem. If you have contributed to any Pact Open Source projects or have engaged with Pact social media and Slack chats, you are welcome to share us your thoughts! The data collected in this survey is anonymous. We intend to use the data to better serve you and to promote the Pact community. Complete the survey [here](https://forms.office.com/r/ccxYTMxhJm).

## Brought to Life through Visualizations

Earlier in the year [we mentioned we rolled out Orbit.love](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2022/06/08/pact-open-source-update-june-2022#our-awesome-community) to help us track activities across the Pact Foundation's many open doors.

I would login into GitHub, Slack, YouTube, Slack Overflow, Twitter, check my emails, all before I could get down to any work. I imagine the story is much the same for our maintainers, when they get that precious free time to code, it can be exhausting. Orbit gives me a single view I can go to every day, and see who is posting asking for help, or where the activity is, so I can come jump in a help out.

We’re still in the process of determining the most effective usage and views of the data, in a wider context rather than just helping us on the day to day. We are thinking about ways we can expose the dataset (as it’s all publicly available information from GitHub), so that you can tell us what you make of it. Think of it as an interactive _state of open-source_ survey if you will! The good news is that we’ll be doing so together with our friends over at the [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) communities. We even hope to extend it over the SmartBear GitHub account too.

### Pact community engagement in 2022

### Community growth in 2022 

We saw over 3,000 of you interacting with us via our open source channels, and introduced 2.7k more into the fold.

### The 2022 community heroes. 

Thank you for participating in the Pact community, we couldn’t do it without you.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19932401/207966721-f96282be-e00c-45d5-b03a-7b4709aec8b1.png)

We really couldn't resist taking a look at what organizations are using (and we hope loving) Pact. The list below is ordered by organization employee count.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19932401/207972596-9b98890f-cbfb-47d6-ba31-f88b720130b9.png)

We're a small team at Pact, so we also rely and appreciate contributions by teams and individuals leveraging Pact. Below is a list of organizations ordered by the active members using Pact who have interacted with our public repos. In most cases, these are individual people, or small teams often giving back improvements to the Pact framework from time out in the field. Why not read some of their testimonials and case studies [here](https://docs.pact.io/users/testimonials) and add one of your own :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:

### Community growth since 2013 

We looked back on the history as Pact, as we near 10 years, over 12 thousand of you have followed along.

I wrote an interactive history lesson of Pact which you can check out [here](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2022/11/17/pact-facts-a-history-lesson)

## Big innovations: the Pact Plugin Framework

We were pleased to launch the Pact Plugin Framework to the masses. As with all our major initiatives, it is true to our open source roots and we hope that unlock new capabilities to a community of builders.

Our first plugin provides support for testing gRPC with Pact, and Pacts core, built in Rust, provides a Foreign Function Interface, unlocking Pact’s capabilities in supporting languages.We look forward to 2023 and the introduction of Pact’s feature-set to a few more languages, some of which are waiting to be built.

> _Hopefully by you!_

In the meantime, why not get powered by Pact plugins and create your own?

## Supporters of Pact

Pact’s biggest sponsor got even bigger this year.

![SbHeartPact](https://docs.pact.io/assets/images/pactflow-smartbear-77908456e1d225c6c1bde17d4eb9a3e9.png)

Pact arose while PactFlow's Co-Founders Beth Skurrie, Ron Holshausen and Matt Fellows were employed by Australian technology consultancy, [DiUS](https://dius.com.au/), supporting companies of all sizes to transition to cloud-native application development and to accelerate their digital initiatives. 

PactFlow is now part of a much wider quality initiative after being [acquired by SmartBear](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2022/04/06/pactflow-joins-smartbear). We care so much for OSS and are so pleased that SmartBear has a strong and demonstrated commitment to OSS — as proven through the support and scale of Cucumber and Swagger. Through our partnership, we will be able to take contract testing to new heights and help deliver key milestones in Pact’s OSS roadmap, and bring closer alignments between our now larger family of open source tools, and smooth pathways between our open source and commercial tools. Providing you a seamless, and wonderful experience, whichever tool you are using.

> We are always on the look-out for new contributors, across any of our languages, and if you have interest or have used Swagger, Cucumber or BDD principles in the past, we would love to hear from you. Drop me a note in [Slack](http://slack.pact.io/).

_We would also love to wish our **[DiUS](https://dius.com.au/)** family thanks for all the support, and helping us reach bigger heights, and ultimately help more people. **We'll slip an extra shrimp on the barbie for you.**_

## What's in store for Pact in 2023?

With a successful 2022 under our belts, I am so excited for what 2023 has instore! You can check out [Canny](https://pact.canny.io/), our public feature board for the latest run down on upcoming initiatives.

> If you feel like something is missing, why not request it, or come talk to us in our [Slack](http://slack.pact.io/)?

## Pact Almanac 2022

I always love the idea of Almanac’s, probably from being sucked into Back to the Future as a kid!

So here is my go, a  veritable buffet, corralling of some of the best bits of the year, mainly in your own words. There is so much good juice out there, for this Devo Avo to squeeze. I won’t focus on any of the big milestones centrally in the project, but rather your individual contributions and wins, you can go through our [blogs](https://docs.pact.io/blog) bi-monthly updates, or check the [GitHub repo’s](https://github.com/pact-foundation) themselves for an immutable source of truth. 🕵️
