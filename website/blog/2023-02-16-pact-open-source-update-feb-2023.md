Welcome all, it’s February, we are live, and this is another update from the Pact Open Source team.

## Let’s Pact Party like it’s 1999
  
2023 marks a special celebration for Pact, 10 years since the first commit brought it to life.  

![first commit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19932401/202204239-f2bfa18e-5ff3-450a-b037-8d0a5cc5387d.png)

Read more about the history to date [here](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2022/11/17/pact-facts-a-history-lesson#the-birth-of-pact-ruby)
  
We intend to celebrate that fact with the people who helped make it great, the community, its maintainers and advocates. We want to help make it an experience that you won’t forget, but we also want it to help bring in new contributors and ideas to the field.

Getting involved with an open source project – Pact or otherwise – [can be extremely rewarding](https://docs.pact.io/contributing#why-get-involved-in-open-source-anyway) and allow you to give back to a community in a meaningful way.
