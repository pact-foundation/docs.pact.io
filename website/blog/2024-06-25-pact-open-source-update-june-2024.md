## Community Events

Are you talking about Pact or contract-testing this year at an event? Why not let us know and get yourself featured!

## GitHub Merge Festival - Berlin

We had a great time at [GitHub's Merge festival in Berlin](https://merge.berlin/)), where we had the opportunity to meet some of you in person. It was great to see the community come together and share their experiences with Pact. We also had the opportunity to listen to some of the GitHub team and other event members, and discuss how we can continue to work together to make the developer experience even better.

If you are close to Berlin but didn't get to this event, don't miss the [WeAreDevelopers World Congress](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress) on 17-19 July 2024. We won't be there unfortunately, but it's a great event to attend if you are in the area.
