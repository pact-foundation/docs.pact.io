[Docker](https://www.docker.com)

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


Depending on the workshop

- [Node + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Other any other language as prescribed by the workshop

One of the workshop flavours

* [JS](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js)
* [Golang](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-go)
* [.NET](https://github.com/pactflow/pact-workshop-dotnet-core-v1)
* [JVM - Gradle/Junit4/Springboot](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-jvm-spring)
* [JVM - Maven/Junit5/Springboot](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-Maven-Springboot-JUnit5)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-workshop-ruby-v2)
* [Android](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-workshop-android)

We would recommended the JS workshop, and will assume you are using that for the rest of the tutorial.

The principles apply in the other workshops, but some of the commands might vary slight. Each projects documentation
should contain up to date commands relative to each language.

If you have trouble, reach out in [Slack](https://slack.pact.io), we appreciate contributions and fixes back
to the workshops as well.
