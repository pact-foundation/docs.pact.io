- [step 1: **create consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step1#step-1---simple-consumer-calling-provider): Create our consumer before the Provider API even exists
- [step 2: **unit test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails): Write a unit test for our consumer
- [step 3: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue): Write a Pact test for our consumer
- [step 4: **pact verification**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider): Verify the consumer pact with the Provider API
- [step 5: **fix consumer**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go): Fix the consumer's bad assumptions about the Provider
- [step 6: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step6#step-6---consumer-updates-contract-for-missing-products): Write a pact test for `404` (missing User) in consumer
- [step 7: **provider states**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step7#step-7---adding-the-missing-states): Update API to handle `404` case
- [step 8: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step8#step-8---authorization): Write a pact test for the `401` case
- [step 9: **pact test**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step9#step-9---implement-authorisation-on-the-provider): Update API to handle `401` case
- [step 10: **request filters**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step10#step-10---request-filters-on-the-provider): Fix the provider to support the `401` case
- [step 11: **pact broker**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step11#step-11---using-a-pact-broker): Implement a broker workflow for integration with CI/CD
- [step 12: **pactflow broker**](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js/tree/step12#step-12---using-a-pactflow-broker): Implement a managed pactflow workflow for integration with CI/CD

_NOTE: Each step is tied to, and must be run within, a git branch, allowing you to progress through each stage incrementally. For example, to move to step 2 run the following: `git checkout step2`_
