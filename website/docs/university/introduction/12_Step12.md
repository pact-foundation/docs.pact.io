**honours course**

When a consumer contract is published, we want to trigger a provider build, in order to verify the contract.

We can simulate this locally and explore the techniques involved.

Update your docker-compose file to support webhooks running from your local machine

1. in `docker-compose.yaml`

```yml
      PACT_BROKER_WEBHOOK_SCHEME_WHITELIST: http
      PACT_BROKER_WEBHOOK_HOST_WHITELIST: host.docker.internal
```

Recreate or Start the Pact Broker if its not already running

1. `docker compose up -d`

Start the fake broker webhook service

1. `npm install` - we need to install the dependencies for a fake broker-webhook service.
1. `npm run start --prefix broker-webhook`

```console

> broker-webhook@1.0.0 start
> node server.js

## CI Simulator ## Broker webhook is listening on port 9090...
```

Publish a webhook to our Pact broker

1. `npm run create-webhook --prefix broker-webhook`

```sh
curl http://host.docker.internal:8000/webhooks \
    -X POST --user pact_workshop:pact_workshop \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @broker-create-body.json -v
```

This will send the following payload.

```json
{
"events": [
  {
    "name": "contract_content_changed"
  }
],
"request": {
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "http://host.docker.internal:9090",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "state": "${pactbroker.githubVerificationStatus}",
    "description": "Pact Verification Tests ${pactbroker.providerVersionTags}",
    "context": "${pactbroker.providerName}",
    "target_url": "${pactbroker.verificationResultUrl}"
  }
}
}
```

```console
> broker-webhook@1.0.0 create-webhook
> ./create_webhook.sh

Note: Unnecessary use of -X or --request, POST is already inferred.

```

Run the consumer pact tests

1. `npm run test:pact --prefix consumer`

Publish the consumer pact tests

1. `npm run pact:publish --prefix consumer`

```console
> consumer@0.1.0 pact:publish
> pact-broker publish ./pacts --consumer-app-version="1.0.1" --auto-detect-version-properties --broker-base-url=http://127.0.0.1:8000 --broker-username pact_workshop --broker-password pact_workshop

Created FrontendWebsite version 1.0.1 with branch all_steps
Pact successfully published for FrontendWebsite version 1.0.1 and provider ProductService.
  View the published pact at http://127.0.0.1:8000/pacts/provider/ProductService/consumer/FrontendWebsite/version/1.0.1
  Events detected: contract_published, contract_content_changed (first time untagged pact published)
  Webhook QxdSU5uCDllJTLDS_iLbNg triggered for event contract_content_changed.
    View logs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/triggered-webhooks/f8299b7a-53c4-4f5f-b4a8-7f87dbee1bdf/logs
  Next steps:
    * Add Pact verification tests to the ProductService build. See https://docs.pact.io/go/provider_verification
```

This will trigger the provider tests.

```console
## CI Simulator ## Broker webhook is listening on port 9090...
Got webhook {"state":"pending","description":"Pact Verification Tests ","context":"ProductService","target_url":""} 
 Triggering provider tests...
provider-verification: 
> product-service@1.0.0 test:pact
> jest --testTimeout 30000 --testMatch "**/*.pact.test.js"
```

Try publishing the contract again. You'll note the broker webhook does not trigger a 2nd time as the content has not changed.

```console
> consumer@0.1.0 pact:publish
> pact-broker publish ./pacts --consumer-app-version="1.0.1" --auto-detect-version-properties --broker-base-url=http://127.0.0.1:8000 --broker-username pact_workshop --broker-password pact_workshop

Updated FrontendWebsite version 1.0.1 with branch step12
Pact successfully republished for FrontendWebsite version 1.0.1 and provider ProductService with no content changes.
  View the published pact at http://127.0.0.1:8000/pacts/provider/ProductService/consumer/FrontendWebsite/version/1.0.1
  Events detected: contract_published
  No enabled webhooks found for the detected events

```

Try updating the version of the contract, in `consumer/package.json`

```json
    "pact:publish": "pact-broker publish ./pacts --consumer-app-version=\"1.0.2\" --auto-detect-version-properties --broker-base-url=http://127.0.0.1:8000 --broker-username pact_workshop --broker-password pact_workshop",
```

You'll again note, that as the contract version has changed, but the contents have not changed, since the last verification, the Pact Broker is aware of this, pre-verifying the Pact without needing to trigger the provider build.

```
> consumer@0.1.0 pact:publish
> pact-broker publish ./pacts --consumer-app-version="1.0.2" --auto-detect-version-properties --broker-base-url=http://127.0.0.1:8000 --broker-username pact_workshop --broker-password pact_workshop

Created FrontendWebsite version 1.0.2 with branch step12
Pact successfully published for FrontendWebsite version 1.0.2 and provider ProductService.
  View the published pact at http://127.0.0.1:8000/pacts/provider/ProductService/consumer/FrontendWebsite/version/1.0.2
  Events detected: contract_published (pact content is the same as previous versions with tags  and no new tags were applied)
  No enabled webhooks found for the detected events
```

If you update the Pact contracts and attempt to republish under an existing version number, you will be stopped by the Pact Broker.

This ensures contracts remain consistent once published.

```console
> consumer@0.1.0 pact:publish
> pact-broker publish ./pacts --consumer-app-version="1.0.2" --auto-detect-version-properties --broker-base-url=http://127.0.0.1:8000 --broker-username pact_workshop --broker-password pact_workshop

Cannot change the content of the pact for ProductService version 1.0.2 and provider ProductService, as race conditions will cause unreliable results for can-i-deploy. Each pact must be published with a unique consumer version number. Some Pact libraries generate random data when a concrete value for a type matcher is not specified, and this can cause the contract to mutate - ensure you have given example values for all type matchers. For more information see https://docs.pact.io/go/versioning

     {
       "request": {
-        "path": "/product/10"
+        "path": "/product/11"
       }
     },
     ... ,
```
