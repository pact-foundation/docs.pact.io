In the scenario, you will create, publish and use your first [Pact Plugin](https://docs.pact.io/plugins).

We will use a templated project that you can use, to help reduce the amount of boilerplate required to write your Plugin.

The course is written in Golang, however, extensive experience with the language will not be required for the workshop.
