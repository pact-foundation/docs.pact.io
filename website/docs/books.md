We're not aware of any books currently dedicated to contract testing, but here are some that talk about Pact and contract testing as part of a broader microservices development and testing strategy:

* [Building Microservices](https://samnewman.io/books/)
* [Testing in Brief: Using Hoverfly, Pact, and Containers](https://www.amazon.com/Microservices-Testing-Brief-Hoverfly-Containers-ebook/dp/B0876N9SP6)
* [Testing Java Microservices: Using Arquillian, Hoverfly, AssertJ, JUnit, Selenium, and Mockito](https://www.amazon.com/Alex-Soto-Bueno/dp/1617292893)
