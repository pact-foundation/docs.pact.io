In the scenario, you will create, publish and use your first [Pact Plugin](https://docs.pact.io/plugins).

We will use a templated project that you can use, to help reduce the amount of boilerplate required to write your Plugin.

The course is written in Golang, however, extensive experience with the language will not be required for the workshop.

## Workshop Prerequisites

* Have a GitHub account and be logged in to it

## Goals

You will:

1. Understand the basics of the Pact Plugin framework
2. Learn the basics of plugins by creating a simple Content Matcher plugin
3. Publish the plugin to GitHub so that it can be used by others
4. Use the plugin in a project
