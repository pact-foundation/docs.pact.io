The Pact-JVM project releases three types of artifacts: Java JAR files to Maven Central, a Gradle plugin to plugins.gradle.org
and Pact files to pact-foundation.pact.dius.com.au.

## 1. Required Credentials and Software

### Getting access to release to Maven Central

The Maven Central repository is provided by Sonatype. You need to signup to their Jira at 
https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa and then get a Pact-JVM administrator to raise a ticket
to get your user permission to publish to the `au.com.dius` project.

### Access to Gradle plugin portal

You need to get an API key to publish the Pact-JVM Gradle plugin from the current owner of the plugin on the plugin 
portal. The plugin is listed at https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/au.com.dius.pact.

### Getting access to the pact-foundation.pact.dius.com.au broker (can skip this step)

You can request access to the broker by emailing support@pactflow.io. This step can also be skipped.

### Create a PGP key

Maven Central has a requirement that all artifacts are signed. You need to create a GPG key for this. See 
https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html for more information.

### Install the JDK required for the version being released

The JAR files must be built with minimum required JDK version. You may need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable 
to point to this version of the JDK. The minimum JDK versions are listed at [Supported JDK and specification versions](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-jvm#supported-jdk-and-specification-versions).
[SdkMan](https://sdkman.io/) is a very good tool for managing different JDK versions.

## 2. Setting up your local Gradle

All the credentials from step 1 need to go into your local gradle property file. For UNIX based systems, this will
be in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.

```
sonatypeUsername              # this is the username you signed up with at the Sonatype Jira
sonatypePassword              # this is your sonatype Jira password
gradle.publish.key            # this is the Gradle plugin portal API key
gradle.publish.secret         # this is the Gradle plugin portal API key secret
signing.keyId                 # this is your GPG key ID (run `gpg -K` to see this)
signing.password              # GPG key password
signing.secretKeyRingFile     # Path to the GPG secret key file (should be ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg)
pactBrokerToken               # This is the API token to pact-foundation.pact.dius.com.au broker
```

## 3. Running the release script

You can run the release script `releasePrep.groovy` in the root of the project. It will prompt you for all
the steps to run. For most of the time you can just hit `ENTER` for the default values.  Use `Control-C` any time to abort.

If any step fails, you can re-run the script once you have fixed the issue and select `n` for all the steps already run to skip them.
Most of the steps should only ever be run once for a particular version.

The script will check the version of the JDK, and allow you to abort if it is not correct.

```console
$ ./releasePrep.groovy 
==>: git pull
Already up to date.
==>: ./gradlew --version 2>/dev/null | awk '/^JVM:/ { print $2 }'
Execute Build?: [Y] 
```

This asks if you want to run a full build as part of the release process. You can skip it if you are confident that the
build is ok.

```console
Execute Build?: [Y] n

Describe this release: [Bugfix Release]
```

Next step is to check the changelog and enter a description of the release. The description will be the heading in the
changelog.

```console
Describe this release: [Bugfix Release]enablePending + scala support            
What is the version for this release?: [4.2.14]
```

Just hit enter to accept the version. You shouldn't have to change this.

```console
Describe this release: [Bugfix Release]enablePending + scala support            
What is the version for this release?: [4.2.14]
Update Changelog?: [Y]
```

Hit enter to update the changelog with the details. If you are re-running the release, enter `n` here.

```

Hit `ENTER` to tag and push the commit. It will tag the repo with the version from the previous step. (Enter `n` if you
are re-running the release script)

Publish artifacts to maven central?: [Y]
```

Next step is to build the artifacts and publish them to Maven Central and then upload the Gradle plugin to the Gradle
plugin portal. This will take a little while (15 minutes for me), depending on your machine specs and internet speed.

```console
Publish pacts to pact-foundation.pact.dius.com.au?: [Y] 
```

You can skip this if you don't have a PactFlow API token setup.

```console
Bump version to 4.2.15?: [Y] 
```

Hit `ENTER` here. The last step is to bump the minor version and commit that, so all future dev is against the next version.

```console

All done.

## 4. Release the artifacts uploaded to Sonatype to Maven Central

Log onto [oss.sonatype.org](https://oss.sonatype.org) and select `Staging Repositories` from the menu on the left hand side. 
You should see a new staging repository for `au.com.dius` listed. Select the repository and select the Close button. 
This will close the repository and run all the Maven Central rules.

![close-repo.png](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-jvm/blob/v4.5.x/close-repo.png?raw=true)

Once the repository is successfully closed (it takes a few minutes, select the refresh button to re-load ands wait for the
status to change to `closed`), select the repository again and then select the Release button.

![release-repo](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-jvm/blob/v4.5.x/release-repo.png?raw=true)

## 5. Create a Github release

Create a Github release from the tag created by the release script. The contents should be populated with the
values from the CHANGELOG.md that the release script created.
