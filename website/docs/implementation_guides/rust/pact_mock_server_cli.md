This project provides both a restful web api and command line interface to run pact mock servers. It is a single
executable binary and is able to manage multiple mock servers. The lifecycle of each mock server can be controlled by the
restful web api or through the command line interface. It implements the [V4 Pact specification](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-4).

[Online rust docs](https://docs.rs/pact_mock_server_cli/)

## Command line interface

The mock server is bundles as a single binary executable `pact-mock-server`. Running this with out any options displays
the standard help.

```console,ignore

### Options

The following options are available for all subcommands:

master server using this port.

#### Log level: -l, --loglevel &lt;loglevel&gt;

This sets the log level that the CLI and mock servers log at. It defaults to info. Valid values are: error, warn,
info, debug, trace, none.

### Sub-commands

## Restful JSON API

The master mock server provides a restful JSON API, and this API is what the command line sub-commands use to
communicate and control the master server.

### End points

#### GET /

This returns a list of all running mock servers managed by this master server.

example request:

```ignore
GET http://localhost:8080/ HTTP/1.1
```

example response:

```json
{
  "mockServers": [
    {
      "id": "7d1bf906d0ff42528f2d7d794dd19c5b",
      "port": 52943,
      "provider": "Alice Service",
      "status": "ok"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### POST /

This creates a new mock server from a pact file that must be present as JSON in the body. Returns the details of the mock server
in the response.

example request:

```ignore
POST http://localhost:8080/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```

payload:

```json

          "Content-Type": "text/html"
        },
        "body": "\"That is some good Mallory.\""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

example response:

```json

  "mockServer": {
    "id": "81c3483901e647ba8f545f2842d09cba",
    "port": 58276
  }
}
```

#### Response codes

##### 200 OK

This is returned when if the mock server was created successfully.

##### 422 Unprocessable Entity

This is returned if the pact JSON could not be parsed or the mock server could not be started.

#### GET /mockserver/:id

Returns details of the mock server with `:id`, which can be either a mockserver ID or port number.

example request:

```ignore
GET http://localhost:8080/mockserver/33218 HTTP/1.1
```

example response:

```json

  "status": "error"
}
```

#### Response codes

##### 200 OK

This is returned with a valid mockserver.

##### 404 Not Found

This is returned if no mock server was found with the given ID or port number.

#### POST /mockserver/:id/verify

This checks that the mock server, specified by ID or port number, has met all the expectations of the pact file. If all
expectations have been met, the pact file will be written out to the output directory that was specified with the start
sub-command. If any mismatched requests where received by the mock server, they will be returned.

example request:

```ignore
POST http://localhost:8080/mockserver/33218/verify HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response codes

##### 204 No Content

This is returned when all expectations have been successfully met and the pact file has been written out to the output directory.

##### 422 Unprocessable Entity

This is returned if any expectations have not been met, or any unrecognised requests where received. The details are
returned in the body.

example response:

```json
{
  "mismatches": [
    {
      "method": "GET",
      "path": "/mallory",
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/mallory",

    "id": "3201b3e2f04f402c83b374a077f8f8dd",
    "port": 33218,
    "provider": "Alice Service",
    "status": "error"
  }
}
```

##### 404 Not Found

This is returned if the ID or port number did not correspond to a running mock server or the pact file could not be
written.

#### DELETE /mockserver/:id

Shuts down the mock server with `:id`, which can be either a mockserver ID or port number.

example request:

```ignore
DELETE http://localhost:8080/mockserver/33218 HTTP/1.1
```

#### Response codes

##### 204 No Content

This is returned when the mock server has been shutdown.
