The Pact Broker Client CLI allows you to create, update, delete and query resources in a Pact Broker (including the `can-i-deploy` command).

You can find the documentation for the new cli [here](/implementation_guides/cli/pact-broker-cli).

You can find the documentation for the legacy cli [here](/pact_broker/client_cli/readme).
