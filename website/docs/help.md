## Join the Pact Slack community

Please read the [how to ask for help](/help/how_to_ask_for_help) page first, and chat with us in Slack ([signup](https://slack.pact.io)|[login](https://pact-foundation.slack.com)).

We're on a free plan, so we don't have unlimited history, however, you may be able to find the answer to your question in our searchable archive of our Slack channels on [linen.dev/s/pact-foundation](https://linen.dev/s/pact-foundation).

Questions have also been asked over on StackOverflow, under the [`pact`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pact) tag. This is a great place to ask more general usage questions for pact, and discover existing answers.
