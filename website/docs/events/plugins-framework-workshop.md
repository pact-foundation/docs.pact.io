### Pact Plugin Framework - hands on workshop

Your favourite contract testing framework comes Pact with more power! The new Pact Plugin Framework completes the missing piece to help development teams apply contract testing across all of their API technologies and use cases.

In this hands-on workshop, you will create and run your first Pact Plugin to solve for use cases you previously couldn't.

**We will:**

* Cover the key concepts and components of the Plugin Framework
* Create a new Content Matcher to support a new MIME type
* Publish and release your new Plugin to GitHub
* Add it to a project and run a pact test

**Pre-requisites:**

* A GitHub account
* Programming experience in a language such as Java, .NET, or Javascript 
 
:::note
Whilst this is a 301 level lesson aimed at practitioners wanting to build a plugin, if you're not comfortable in an IDE, writing code and executing builds in CI, you can still 
play along with the instructors.
